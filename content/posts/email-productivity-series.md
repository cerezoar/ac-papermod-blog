In this series, I will be sharing my email tricks to manage my emails at work. This is nothing new. It's just a matter of following what works for me. You can adopt it if its something that resonates and makes sense to you.

I remembered when I started working, I was not organized in anything, lol. I struggled in this area. I do still read my emails but in terms of efficiency and what to do the different emails that I received, I only parked in my inbox. There was a time when I could not keep up with the amount of incoming emails and it accumulates to hundreds and even thousands. Because to this, I usually miss some emails because of this scenario.

That is why I decided to have a system for my emails to organize and streamline in my line of work. These are just simple methods that I use to prioritize and segragate emails that needed different actions.

Follow along to know more.

Regards,
Aldrin
